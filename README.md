OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a powerful tool for image and video processing, and with your Python knowledge, you'll be able to pick it up quickly.

Here’s a step-by-step roadmap to become an expert in OpenCV using Python:

📍 Step 1: Getting Started with OpenCV
Install OpenCV: pip install opencv-python

Learn to:

Read, display, and write images and videos.

Resize, rotate, crop images.

Convert between color spaces (BGR, Grayscale, HSV, etc.).

Practice:

python
Copy
Edit
import cv2

img = cv2.imread('image.jpg')
cv2.imshow('My Image', img)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
📍 Step 2: Basic Image Processing Techniques
Drawing shapes (line, rectangle, circle)

Adding text

Image blending and bitwise operations

Practice topics:

cv2.line(), cv2.rectangle(), cv2.circle(), cv2.putText()

cv2.addWeighted(), cv2.bitwise_and()

📍 Step 3: Image Transformations
Thresholding (binary, adaptive, Otsu’s)

Blurring and Smoothing

Edge Detection (Sobel, Canny)

Morphological Operations (dilation, erosion, opening, closing)

📍 Step 4: Contour Detection
Find contours (cv2.findContours)

Draw contours

Hierarchies and approximation

Bounding rectangles, enclosing circles

📍 Step 5: Color Detection and Masking
HSV color space for better color segmentation

Creating masks and applying filters

📍 Step 6: Object Detection Basics
Shape detection

Face detection using Haar cascades

Tracking objects using color

📍 Step 7: Image Gradients and Pyramids
Understanding image pyramids (Gaussian, Laplacian)

Image pyramids for blending and zooming

📍 Step 8: Video Processing
Capture video from webcam or file

Frame-by-frame processing

Saving processed videos

📍 Step 9: Advanced Topics
Background subtraction

Motion detection

Template matching

Feature detection (SIFT, SURF, ORB)

📍 Step 10: Real-Time Projects
Build mini-projects like:

Real-time face mask detector

Object counter

Motion detector

Barcode/QR code scanner
